## 💡 Project Overview

A simple and intuitive robotic arm controlled using **two Arduino joysticks**.  
The system uses **four servo motors** to provide full movement:  
- One servo for the **base rotation**  
- Two servos for the **arm joints**  
- One servo for the **end effector/gripper**

This setup allows smooth, manual control and is ideal for learning robotics, kinematics, and Arduino-based motion control.

This project demonstrates how a robotic arm can be manually controlled using two analog joysticks connected to an Arduino Uno.  
Each joystick axis corresponds to a different servo, giving users direct and natural control over the arm's movements.  

The system is designed to be:  
- Easy to operate  
- Highly responsive  
- Beginner-friendly for robotics and electronics learners  

The Arduino reads joystick input values, maps them to servo angles, and drives the robotic arm in real time.
